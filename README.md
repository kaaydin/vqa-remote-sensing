# RSVQA: Visual question answering for remote sensing data

This is a fork of the original repository, which can be found here: [RSVQA](https://github.com/syvlo/RSVQA)

Adjustments have been made to easily import the HR dataset and start training.

To set-up the repo for training, follow the steps below:

Download the HR dataset from [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/6344367) and place the JSON files in the `data/text` folder.
Extract and move the images to the `data/images` folder.

Download the pretrained skip-thoughts model files:


[http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rkiros/models/dictionary.txt]('http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rkiros/models/dictionary.txt')
[http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rkiros/models/utable.npy]('http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rkiros/models/utable.npy')
[http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rkiros/models/uni_skip.npz]('http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rkiros/models/uni_skip.npz')
[http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rkiros/models/btable.npy]('http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rkiros/models/btable.npy')
[http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rkiros/models/bi_skip.npz]('http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rkiros/models/bi_skip.npz')

and place them in the `data/skip-thoughts` folder.

If you receive a decode error when running the `train.py` script, try to change the encoding of the dictionary.txt file to `utf-8` or remove special characters from the file.

```bash
# remove special characters
sed -i 's/[^ -~]/_/g' dictionary.txt
```

Install pytorch with the following command (venv recommended):

```bash
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121 # or cu118
```

Install the remaining dependencies:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
    

# RSVQA Code
This readme presents the step required to generate the databases and reproduce the results presented in [1]. Please cite this article if you use this code.


## Training the models
The files regarding the model are put in the VQA_model folder.
The architecture is defined in models/model.py, and you can use train.py to launch a training.

You will need, in addition to the packages found in requirements.txt, to install skipthoughts:

    git clone https://github.com/Cadene/skip-thoughts.torch.git
    cd skip-thoughts.torch/pytorch
    python setup.py install

Available here:

# Thanks
The authors would like to thank Rafael FÃ©lix for his remarks and the requirements.txt file.
