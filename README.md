# VQA Remote Sensing

## Introduction 

### Problem Statement

Advancements in sensing technology have led to a large volume of visual info being acquired and processed in the Remote Sensing (RS) domain. RS data has immense potential for various tasks (e.g., land cover classification, object detection) which could benefit numerous applications. Current methods are static and task-specific and require specialized expert knowledge â€“ hindering generic and easy access to the information.

### Proposed Solution 

Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering System (RSVQA) allows for info extraction via queries formulated in natural language. VQA enables answering of free-form and open-ended questions - providing a more intuitive solution to data extraction / analysis. This approach can address problems such as specific object detection (e.g., "Is there a
thatched roof in this image?") and complex tasks, e.g., relations btw. different objects ("Is there a building on the right of the river?").
